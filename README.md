# Anubis
Old 2.6.X kernel project to remotely validate the execution of running binaries, Old project from 2003.

THinking on maybe changing it for old systems that cannot be upgraded but need to be controlled, as the central server can be a modern linux (Verified the server binary compiled, excuse the warnings)

PS LICENSE IS NOT VALID ANYMORE BUT I WANTED TO PRESERVE IT AS HISTORICAL PURPOSES!!!!
